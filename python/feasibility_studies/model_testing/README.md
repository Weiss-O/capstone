#Model testing directory

This file will contain descriptions of the cv models to be tested,
the tests to be run, and the results.

##Goals of CV model testing
The goals of testing are to understand whether workshop tools can be 
identified in images.Various people-detecting models will need to be tested as well.
Person detection and tracking will need to be used in the case that cv models cannot reliably identify objects of interest.

The tests will evaluate the impact of the following on various models in an attempt to find a model that 
is sufficient.

If no models are sufficient on their own, then some other context-driven algorithms will need to be used.
These algorithms and corresponding tests are located in the algorithm-tests directory

#Models to be tested:



#Test 1 - Human detection
