# Algorithm Testing Ground

This directory contains code for testing algorithms. These algorithms will be used
for tracking people and objects in the space. Algorithms will rely on chronological and user-input context to make up for shortcomings in any cv models.

#Algorithm Overview
Spacial Understanding
* Detecting walls, floor, and worksurfaces to help generate projector commands
* Tracking objects positions by tracking positions of humans within the space
* Generating region proposals for the CV models based off of the above
* May rely on patterned stickers for spacial understanding
